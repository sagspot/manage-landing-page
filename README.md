# Frontend Mentor - Manage landing page

![Design preview for the Manage landing page coding challenge](./images/desktop-preview.jpg)

**To do this challenge, basic understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript are needed.**

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See all testimonials in a horizontal slider
- Receive an error message when the newsletter sign up `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

## Where to find everything

The task is to build out the project to the designs provided. Both mobile and desktop versions of the designs have been provided. 

The designs are in JPG static format. This means to use the best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. This helps train the eye to perceive differences in spacings and sizes.

All required assets have been provided in the `/images` folder and are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file, which contains the information needed, such as color palette and fonts.

## Building the project

Below is the suggested workflow process.

1. Initialize the project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/). This makes it easier to share the code with the community if in need of some help.
2. Configure the repository to publish the code to [Vercel](https://bit.ly/fem-vercel). This will also be useful if in need of some help during a challenge as the project URL can be shared. 
3. Look through the designs to start planning out how to tackle the project. This step is crucial to help think ahead for CSS classes to enable reusable styles.
4. Before adding any styles, structure the content with HTML. Writing HTML first can help focus attention on creating well-structured content.
5. Write out the base styles for the project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
6. Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section once the current section is satisfactorily complete.

## Deploying the project

1. [Sign up to Vercel](https://bit.ly/fem-vercel-signup) and go through the onboarding flow, ensuring GitHub account is connected by using their [Vercel for GitHub](https://vercel.com/docs/v2/git-integrations/vercel-for-github) integration.
2. Connect the project to Vercel from the ["Import project" page](https://vercel.com/import), using the "From Git Repository" button and selecting the project to be deployed.
3. Once connected, every `git push`, Vercel will create a new [deployment](https://vercel.com/docs/v2/platform/deployments) and the deployment URL will be shown on the [Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard). An email will also be sent for each deployment with the URL.

## Sharing the solution

There are multiple places to share the solution:

1. Submit it on the platform so that other users will see it. Here's our ["Complete guide to submitting solutions"](https://medium.com/frontend-mentor/a-complete-guide-to-submitting-solutions-on-frontend-mentor-ac6384162248).
2. Share the solution page in the **#finished-projects** channel of the [Slack community](https://www.frontendmentor.io/slack).
3. Tweet [@frontendmentor](https://twitter.com/frontendmentor) and mention **@frontendmentor** including the repo and live URLs in the tweet. Frontend entor would love to take a look at the solution and help share it around.

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
